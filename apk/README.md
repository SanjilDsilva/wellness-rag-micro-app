# APK Information – Wellness RAG Micro-App

## Overview

This folder contains the Android APK for the *Wellness RAG Micro-App – “Ask Me Anything About Yoga”*.

The APK is a lightweight wrapper around the web-based frontend of the application, created to allow easy mobile testing and evaluation without requiring a full native Android build.

The core logic (RAG pipeline, safety checks, and data logging) runs entirely on the backend and is accessed via API calls from the frontend.

---

## How the APK Was Created

* The frontend is a simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript web application.
* The APK was generated by wrapping the web app into a WebView-based Android container.
* The APK points to the locally hosted / deployed backend API.

This approach was chosen to:

* Keep the focus on RAG architecture and backend safety logic (as required by the assignment)
* Avoid unnecessary native Android complexity
* Still provide a testable mobile experience

---

## How to Test the APK

1. Install the APK on any Android device (Android 8+ recommended).
2. Ensure the backend server is running and accessible.
3. Open the app and enter a yoga-related query.
4. Observe:

   * AI-generated answer
   * Displayed sources
   * Safety warnings for risky queries

---

## Notes

* The APK is fully functional and tested.
* No sensitive credentials are embedded in the APK.
* All AI logic, safety filtering, and logging are handled server-side.

---

## Limitations

* This is not a fully native Android application.
* UI is intentionally minimal to prioritize clarity and explainability.
* Performance depends on backend availability.

---

## Reasoning

The goal of this submission is to demonstrate:

* Correct RAG design
* Responsible safety handling for wellness queries
* Clean backend architecture
* Transparent source attribution

Rather than UI complexity, the focus is on correctness, safety, and explainability.
